# Cosmic Ancestry App Development

## Background and Motivation
The Cosmic Ancestry app is designed to provide users with a personalized visualization of their cosmic radiation profile based on their birth information. The app uses 3D visualization to create an immersive experience for users to explore their cosmic ancestry.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
1. 3D Visualization Implementation
   - Need to create an engaging and interactive 3D space visualization
   - Must handle different cosmic elements and radiation levels
   - Should be performant and responsive

2. Data Processing
   - Need to calculate cosmic radiation levels based on birth information
   - Must handle various input formats and validate data
   - Should provide meaningful and accurate results

## High-level Task Breakdown
1. ✅ Set up project structure and dependencies
2. ✅ Create basic form for user input
3. ✅ Implement 3D visualization component
4. ✅ Create API service for cosmic data
5. ✅ Integrate form with visualization
6. ⬜ Enhance 3D visualization with more cosmic elements
7. ⬜ Implement actual cosmic radiation calculation logic
8. ⬜ Add error handling and loading states
9. ⬜ Add animations and transitions
10. ⬜ Implement responsive design
11. ⬜ Add unit tests
12. ⬜ Add documentation

## Lessons
- Use 'use client' directive for client-side components in Next.js
- Implement proper loading states for better UX
- Use TypeScript interfaces for better type safety
- Use Framer Motion for smooth animations
- Use React Three Fiber for 3D visualizations
